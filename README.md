#  Self-introduction

## Summary
I have been interested in programming since I was a little boy, but I could not take the plunge.
However, with the release of SwiftUI, I can now easily create apps, and I am currently developing several apps.

## Skill
- SwiftUI ( 2020 ~ )
  This is the main technology I use. I also use the following APIs related to this technology
ãƒ»WidgetKit
ãƒ»App Intents
ãƒ»Core Data
ãƒ»KeyValueStore

- Javascript for Safari Web Extension ( 2023 ~ )
Javascript is used to develop Safari extensions. I use it minimally and am not an expert in it.

## Apps
Recently released apps are shown at the top of each.

### Developed Apps
- Word Filter X
  This app is a Safari extension that blocks words.
  (iOS/iPadOS/macOS)
- Simple Editor X
  It is a text editor that can read out text to check for strange expressions.
  (macOS)

### Porting app
Coming soon

###ã€€Localized Apps
- Declutter for Safari 
  When the same URL is opened in different tabs, delete one of them to organize the tabs.
  (macOS)
