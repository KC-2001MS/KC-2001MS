#  Self-introduction

## Summary
I have been interested in programming since I was a little boy, but I could not take the plunge.  
However, with the release of SwiftUI, I can now easily create apps, and I am currently developing several apps.

## Skill
- SwiftUI ( 2020 ~ )  
  This is the main technology I use. I also use the following APIs related to this technology  
ãƒ»WidgetKit  
ãƒ»App Intents  
ãƒ»Core Data  
ãƒ»KeyValueStore  

- Javascript for Safari Web Extension ( 2023 ~ )  
Javascript is used to develop Safari extensions. I use it minimally and am not an expert in it.

## Apps
Recently released apps are shown at the top of each.

### Developed Apps
This application is a list of applications I have developed with additional functionality. Some of the original applications may exist.  
- Uncheck X ( Under development )  
Resets checkboxes and radio buttons that are selected by default on the Web site to unselected status.
- [Word Filter X](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/word-filter-x/id1668831130) ( 2023 ~ )  
  This app is a Safari extension that blocks words.  
  This app is based on "Hiyoko Filter".  
  (iOS/iPadOS/macOS)
- [Simple Editor X](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-editor-x/id1612026794) ( 2022 ~ )  
  It is a text editor that can read out text to check for strange expressions.  
  (macOS)

### Porting app
This is a port of an existing application. Basically, there is no functionality that I implemented.
- [Death to _Blanck](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1672080999) ( 2023 ~ )  
Sometimes when you open a link on a web page, it opens in a different tab, right? This extension prevents that phenomenon.
[The original extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/death-to-blank/gneobebnilffgkejpfhlgkmpkipgbcno?gl=JP&hl=ja) exists as a Chrome extension.  
(macOS)  
We plan to port it to iOS and iPadOS, but we have not yet determined when that will be because it has failed Apple's review process.
  

### Localized App
These are the list of applications involved in the translation.
- [Declutter for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/id1574021257) ( 2022 )  
  When the same URL is opened in different tabs, delete one of them to organize the tabs.
  (macOS)
